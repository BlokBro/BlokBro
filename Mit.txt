The MIT system (instant transaction mapping) will be an integration that we will bring for all users who will have IDaddress. MIT can instantly map and geolocate all address transactions that have been verified by the user.
If the user is robbed of his address, he can resort to his MIT area that will inform him where his cryptos are . This system will be able to identify even if the stolen cryptocurrencies have been changed to other cryptocurrencies by informing the user clearly, simply , and even before they are confirmed on the new address. The advantage that the user will have is to know where the cryptocurrencies are going even before the transaction is confirmed by Blockchain. The user , together with our team, can notify the exchenge or the police to inform them where their cryptocurrencies are going, to have the opportunity to act promptly to the recovery . In the future we would like to collaborate and make our system available to all law enforcement to help them with these crypto theft issues
The MIT service will be free of charge and can be used exclusively for registered users.
