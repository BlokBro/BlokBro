The IDaddress system (identification address) has been designed to inform and help users in their payments. With this system, you will be able to know to whom you are sending your cryptos. All traders can be sure that their customers do not fall into the trap of scammers because they can assign their data to their address , thus informing the user that he can instantly observe that that address is verified and that it belongs to that vendor. ( the verification applicant can decide what data to show to the public..more information will show and more will be credible)
When making the request for verification of their addresses , the user or the company , must send all the data that are requested . ​To ensure that the applicant’s address is in his possession , at the time of sending the data, a $1 transaction will be required via the address you want to verify ( To address BLKB the amount sent will be burned).  
VERY IMPORTANT : NO ONE OUTSIDE THE BLOKBRO SYSTEM CAN DO THIS, IF SOMEONE ASKS FOR MONEY TO DO THIS , IGNORE IT AND REPORT IT TO OUR SERVICE.
The verification request will be discarded if such data are found to be bogus or incomplete. The data of the user who requests verification , after being approved, will be encrypted and made visible only those you have chosen.
The user or the company who will have verified IDaddress can receive prizes in BLKB through the dedicated area. These rewards will be issued after leaving a Freedback to the user who has made the transaction. This will always be used by users to be able to share with all the public that that address is positive or negative . 
Features awards in BLKB:
- If the Freedbeck is positive both/zero users will receive the prize.
- If the Freedbeck is negative, only the sender of the Freedbeck will receive the prize.
- ​The amount of the prize will vary over time , you will start with 500 BLKB and every 1 year will be the halving of the premium.
