Blokbro offers the IDaddress system with the BLKB token. IDaddress will guarantee the certified identification of the userâ€™s addresses. The owner of such certified addresses will be identifiable and this system will ensure greater transparency and security among the people who buy and sell. With this system it will be possible to release a Freedbak receiving prizes in BLKB, both for sending and for the recipient, for each transaction made to the holder of IDaddress. 
There will be a bonus mechanism based on IDaddress , each user who requests the verification of the address will have to pay $ 1 in BLKB ( this sum will be burned) , registered users will receive prizes in BLKB to each Freedbeck issued for each transaction .
